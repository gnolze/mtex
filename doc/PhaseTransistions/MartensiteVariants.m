% In this section we discuss the austenite to ferrite/martensite phase transformation. 
% As example an EBSD data set collected on a plessitic region of the Emsland iron meteorite will be used.
% This so-called filling iron is a microstructure of bcc and fcc iron as main phases 
% which fills the gaps between huge rims of kamacite (ferrite) and ribbons of taenite (austenite).

% The coincidence of bcc and fcc poles suggests 
% an existing orientation relationship between both phases. 
% The Kurdjumov-Sachs (KS) orientation relationship model assumes 
% a transformation of one of the {111}-fcc into one of the {110} 
% bcc planes. Within these planes one of the <110> directions 
% in fcc is assumed to aline parallel to one of the <111> directions
% of bcc. Since in cubic crystals identically indexed (hkl) and [uvw]
% have the same directions, pole figures can be used for both, presentation of 
% lattice directions as well as lattice plane normals.
% Although we could alternatively use the MTEX command 
% |orientation.KurdjumovSachs(cs_aus,cs_bcc)|, let us define the orientation
% relationship explicitely:

KS = orientation.map(Miller(1,1,1,cs_aus),Miller(0,1,1,cs_bcc),...
      Miller(-1,0,1,cs_aus),Miller(-1,-1,1,cs_bcc));


plotPDF(variants(KS,parenOri),'add2all','MarkerFaceColor','none','MarkerEdgeColor','k','linewidth',2)

%%
% In order to evaluate the match between the Kurdjumov-Sachs model
% and the actual orientation relation ship existing in the microstructure, we
% can compute the mean angular deviation between all parent-to-child
% misorientaitons and the considered model

% The parent-to-child misorientations are derived using
mori = inv(childOri) * parenOri;

% whereas the mean angular deviation in degree can be computed by
mean(angle(mori, KS)) ./ degree

%fit = sqrt(mean(min(angle_outer(childOri,variants(KS,parenOri)),[],2).^2))./degree


%% Estimating the parent to child orientation relationship
%
% Since KS represents a simple geometrical model, we have to ask ourself 
% whether there is an orientation relationship description
% that better matches the misorientations measured in the microstructure. 
% A canocial candidate would be the <orientation.mean.html |mean|> of all
% misorientations

% the mean of all measured parent to child misorientations
p2cMean = mean(mori,'robust')

plotPDF(childOri,h_bcc,'MarkerSize',5);
hold on
plotPDF(variants(p2cMean,parenOri),'add2all','MarkerFaceColor','none','MarkerEdgeColor','k','linewidth',2)
hold off

% mean angular deviation in degree
mean(angle(mori, p2cMean)) ./ degree

%%
% Here we have made use of our comfortable situation that we know the parent orientation 
% from the remaining fcc grains. However, if the parent orientation is unknown we may still estimate
% the parent to child orientation relationship soleley from the child to
% child misorientations by the algorithm developed by Tuomo Nyyss√∂nen and available
% by the function <calcParent2Child.html |calcParent2Child|>. This
% iterative algorithm needs as starting point an orientation relationship
% close the actual one. 
% As test, we use the Nishiyama-Wassermann (NW) orientation relationship 
% which expects the same parallel planes like KS but assumes two different lattice directions: 
% <110> of fcc is parallel aligned to <001> of bcc. Despite the different selection of directions, 
% the misorientation between KS and NW is below 6 degrees, i.e. they are both very similar. 
% The advantage of NW is only that it generates 12 different bcc orientations from a single fcc grain 
% whereas from KS 24 so-called variants result.  

% define Nishiyama Wassermann
NW = orientation.NishiyamaWassermann(cs_aus,cs_bcc);

% extract all child to child misorientations 
grainPairs = neighbors(grains('Fe'));
ori = grains(grainPairs).meanOrientation;

% estimate a parent to child orientation relationship
p2cIter = calcParent2Child(ori,NW)

% the mean angular deviation
mean(angle(mori,p2cIter)) ./degree

%%
% We observe that the parent to child orientation relationship computed
% solely from the child to child misorientations fits the actual
% orientation relationship equaly well. 
%
%% Classification of child variants
%
% Once we have determined parent orientations and a parent to child
% orientation relationship we may proceed further by classifying the child
% orientations into different variants. This is computed by the command
% <calcChildVariant.html |calcChildVariant|>.

% compute for each child orientation a variantId
[variantId, packetId] = calcChildVariant(parenOri,childOri,p2cIter);

% colorize the orientations according to the variantID
color = ind2color(variantId);
plotPDF(childOri,color,h_bcc,'MarkerSize',5);

%%
% While it is very hard to distinguish the different variants in the pole
% figure plots it becomes more clear in an axis angle plot

plot(childOri,color,'axisAngle')

%%
% A more important classification is the seperation of the
% variants into packets. 

color = ind2color(packetId);
